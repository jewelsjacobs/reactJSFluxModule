Client will provide ObjectRocket any information ObjectRocket reasonably requests to determine whether ObjectRocket is obligated to collect VAT from Client, including Client&rsquo;s VAT identification number. If Client is legally entitled to an exemption from any sales, use, or similar transaction tax, Client is responsible for providing ObjectRocket with legally-sufficient tax exemption certificates for each taxing jurisdiction. ObjectRocket will apply the tax exemption certificates to charges under Client&rsquo;s account occurring after the date ObjectRocket receives the tax exemption certificates. If any deduction or withholding is required by law, Client will notify ObjectRocket and will pay ObjectRocket any additional amounts necessary to ensure that the net amount that ObjectRocket receives, after any deduction and withholding, equals the amount ObjectRocket would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required. Additionally, Client will provide ObjectRocket with documentation showing that the withheld and deducted amounts have been paid to the relevant taxing authority.</span></p><a href="#" name="id.eac456994a53"></a><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1 c2">7.

General.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Client will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless ObjectRocket, its affiliates and licensors, and each of their respective employees, officers, directors, and representatives from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) arising out of or relating to any third party claim concerning: (a) Client&rsquo;s or any End Users&rsquo; use of the Service Offerings (including any activities under Client&rsquo;s ObjectRocket account and use by Client&rsquo;s employees and personnel); (b) breach of this Agreement or violation of applicable law by Client or any End User; (c) Client Content or the combination of Client Content with other applications, content, or processes, including any claim involving alleged infringement or misappropriation of third-party rights by Client Content or by the use, development, design, production, advertising, or marketing of Client Content; or (d) a dispute between Client and any End User. If ObjectRocket or its affiliates are obligated to respond to a third party subpoena or other compulsory legal order or process described above, Client will also reimburse ObjectRocket for reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, as well as its employees&rsquo; and contractors&rsquo; time and materials spent responding to the third party subpoena or other compulsory legal order or process at ObjectRocket&rsquo;s then-current hourly rates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">10.2. Notice and Process.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;ObjectRocket will promptly notify Client of any claim subject to Section 10.1, but ObjectRocket&rsquo;s failure to promptly notify Client will only affect Client&rsquo;s obligations under Section 10.1 to the extent that ObjectRocket&rsquo;s failure prejudices Client&rsquo;s ability to defend the claim. Client may: (a) use counsel of Client&rsquo;s own choosing (subject to ObjectRocket&rsquo;s written consent) to defend against any claim; and (b) settle the claim as Client deems appropriate, provided that Client obtains ObjectRocket&rsquo;s prior written consent before entering into any settlement. ObjectRocket may also assume control of the defense and settlement of the claim at any time.</span></p><a href="#" name="id.41ba55bc1360"></a><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1 c2">11.
